In particular, the origin of CISS in molecular junctions is a matter of an intense current debate. Here we contend that the necessary conditions for the CISS effect to appear can be generally and fully understood on the basis of a complete symmetry analysis of the molecular junction, and not only of the molecule. Our approach, which draws on the use of point-group symmetries within the scattering formalism for transport, shows that electrode symmetries are as important as those of the molecule when it comes to the emergence of a spin-polarization and, therefore, a possible appearance of CISS. It turns out that standalone metallic nanocontacts can exhibit spin-polarization when relative rotations are introduced which reduce the symmetry. As a corollary, molecular junctions with $\\textbf{achiral}$ molecules can also exhibit spin polarization along the direction of transport, provided that the whole junction is chiral. This formalism also allows to predict the qualitative changes on the spin-polarization upon substitution of a chiral molecule in the junction with its enantiomeric partner.

This allows to efficiently cool the decohering environment of a superconducting resonator, and we see a continuous change in measured physical quantities down to previously unexplored sub-mK temperatures. The $^3$He acts as a heat sink which increases the energy relaxation rate of the quantum bath coupled to the circuit a thousand times, yet the suppressed bath does not introduce additional circuit losses or noise.

Our approach overcomes some of the shortcomings of the recently developed discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) based on Monte-Carlo sampling in a discrete phase space that improves the classical treatment by accounting for lowest-order quantum fluctuations. We provide a rigorous derivation of the DTWA by embedding it in a continuous phase space, thereby introducing a hybrid discrete-continuous truncated Wigner approximation (DCTWA). We derive a set of operator-differential mappings that yield an exact equation of motion (EOM) for the continuous SU(2) Wigner function of spins. The standard DTWA is then recovered by a systematic neglection of specific terms in this exact EOM. The hybrid approach permits us to determine the validity conditions and to gain detailed understanding of the quality of the approximation, paving the way for systematic improvements. Furthermore, we show that the continuous embedding allows for a straightforward extension of the method to open spin systems subject to dephasing, losses and incoherent drive, while preserving the key advantages of the discrete approach, such as a positive definite Wigner distribution of typical initial states. We derive exact stochastic differential equations for processes which cannot be described by the standard DTWA due to the presence of non-classical noise.

In the wide limit with a bottleneck, we show that the weight space view yields the same effective covariance functions which were obtained previously in function space. Also, varying the prior distributions over network parameters is equivalent to employing different kernels. As such, DGPs can be translated into the deep bottlenecked trig networks, with which the exact maximum a posteriori estimation can be obtained. Interestingly, the network representation enables the study of DGP's neural tangent kernel, which may also reveal the mean of the intractable predictive distribution.

We model such systems by taking into account the on-site repulsive interactions between electrons in $p_z$ orbitals and the coupling of the localized $p_z$ orbitals with the 2D conduction bands formed by $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals. The Green's function method within an extended Anderson model is used to calculate the tunneling current through the QDs. We find that bistable tunneling current can exist for such systems due to the interplay of the on-site Coulomb interactions (U) between the $p_z$ orbitals and the delocalized nature of conduction band states derived from the hybridization of $p_x$ / $p_y$ orbitals. This bistable current is not sensitive to the detailed band structure of the two dimensional band, but depends critically on the strength of $U$ and the ratio of the left and right tunneling rates.

In this article, a theoretical framework is presented that extends existing theories by placing the surrounding solution environment on an equal footing with the crystal itself; this is advantageous, e.g., when considering processes such as crystal growth from solution. By considering the polar crystal as a stack of parallel plate capacitors immersed in a solution environment, the equilibrium adsorbed surface charge density is derived by minimizing the free energy of the system. In analogy to the well-known diverging surface energy of a polar crystal surface at zero temperature, for a crystal in solution it is shown that the \"polar catastrophe\" manifests as a diverging free energy cost to perturb the system from equilibrium. Going further than existing theories, the present formulation predicts that fluctuations in the adsorbed surface charge density become increasingly suppressed with increasing crystal thickness. We also show how, in the slab geometry often employed in both theoretical and computational studies of interfaces, an electric displacement field emerges as an electrostatic boundary condition, the origins of which are rooted in the slab geometry itself, rather than the use of periodic boundary conditions. This aspect of the work provides a firmer theoretical basis for the recent observation that standard \"slab corrections\" fail to correctly describe, even qualitatively, polar crystal surfaces in solution.", "output": "For a crystal in solution, the 'polar catastrophe' manifests as a diverging free energy cost to perturb the system from equilibrium, analogous to the well-known diverging surface energy of a polar crystal surface at zero temperature."}, {"instruction": "Do the analytical results agree with the numerical simulations for both switching and extinction rates?", "input": "We consider the rates of noise-induced switching between the stable states of dissipative dynamical systems with delay and also the rates of noise-induced extinction, where such systems model population dynamics.

For weak noise, the rates of inter-attractor switching and extinction are exponentially small. Finding these rates to logarithmic accuracy is reduced to variational problems. The solutions of the variational problems give the most probable paths followed in switching or extinction. We show that the equations for the most probable paths are acausal and formulate the appropriate boundary conditions. Explicit general results are obtained for small delay compared to the relaxation rate. We also develop a direct variational method to find the rates.

This effect is similar to the circular photogalvanic effect in solid-state physics. It can be used to transport neutral bosonic atoms in an optical lattice over a given distance in an arbitrary direction.

In this work, we demonstrate that using the machinery of dissipative quantum state engineering, one can efficiently prepare antiferromagnetic order in present-day experiments with ultracold fermions. The core of the approach is to add incoherent laser scattering in such a way that the antiferromagnetic state emerges as the dark state of the driven-dissipative dynamics.

By considering the polar crystal as a stack of parallel plate capacitors immersed in a solution environment, the equilibrium adsorbed surface charge density is derived by minimizing the free energy of the system. In analogy to the well-known diverging surface energy of a polar crystal surface at zero temperature, for a crystal in solution it is shown that the \"polar catastrophe\" manifests as a diverging free energy cost to perturb the system from equilibrium. Going further than existing theories, the present formulation predicts that fluctuations in the adsorbed surface charge density become increasingly suppressed with increasing crystal thickness.

Taking the partial localization and the coherent tunneling destruction as basic examples, we indicate main advantages of using isospectral exactly-solvable Hamiltonians in studies quantum mechanical systems with two- and three-well potentials.

The dominant mechanisms of caustic formation depend sensitively on the dynamical time scales of the particle motion and of the turbulent flow. For strongly inertial particles in rapidly fluctuating flows, caustic formation is described by a Kramers escape of the particle-velocity gradients. Weakly inertial particles in persistent flows have recently been studied in two spatial dimensions, where caustics are induced by rare excursions of the fluid strain, while vorticity remains small. Here we show that in three dimensions, caustics form by a related, yet different mechanism. At weak particle inertia, caustics are induced by a large, strain-dominated fluctuation of the fluid-velocity gradients. In three dimensions, this fluctuation must cross a characteristic threshold in the $Q$-$R$ plane spanned by the invariants of the fluid-velocity gradients. The most likely way to reach this threshold is by an \"optimal fluctuation\" unique up to similarity transformations, that propagates along the Vieillefosse line.

Each conductance is updated proportionally to the product of the two coefficients. The learning rule is local and proved to perform gradient descent on a loss function. We argue that frequency propagation is an instance of a multi-mechanism learning strategy for physical networks, be it resistive, elastic, or flow networks.

It may happen when the domain wall width by value is approximately in between two lengths: a mean free path with the spin down and spin up. The indirect evidence of this finding is also coming from the fact that homogeneous nanowires shows the most valuable domain wall resistance oscillations by magnitude rather than segmented magnetic nanowires. In addition to the approach, where DW width is constant, the other reasonable model is used when the domain wall can be constrained for some conditions.

We show that for all values of pre-stretch and tube length, the ascending branches all converge to a single curve that is only dependent on the ratio of tube thickness to the outer radius. This curve represents the Maxwell state to be approached in each case (if Euler buckling or axisymmetric wrinkling does not occur first), but this state is pressure-dependent in contrast with the free-ends case.

Recently, we revealed new insights into this process of enhanced diffusion using single-particle tracking (SPT) with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. We found that the mobility of individual enzymes was enhanced three fold in the presence of the substrate, and the motion remained Brownian. In this work, we compare different experimental designs, as well as different data analysis approaches, for studying single enzyme diffusion. We first tether enzymes directly on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) to constrain the diffusion of enzymes to two dimensions. This experimental design recovers the 3-fold enhancement in enzyme diffusion in the presence of the substrate, as we observed before. We also simplify our system by replacing the bulky polymers used in the prior chamber design with a SLB-coated surface and glycerol. Using this newly-designed SLB/glycerol chamber, we compare two different analysis approaches for SPT: the mean-squared displacement (MSD) analysis and the jump-length analysis. We find that the MSD analysis requires high viscosity and large particles to accurately report the diffusion coefficient, while jump-length analysis depends less on the viscosity or size.

Here, by computing the dielectric function of selected narrow- and zero-gap tubes from first principles, we show that the standard effective-mass model of screening systematically underestimates the interaction strength at long wavelength, hence missing the binding of low-energy excitons. The reason is that the model critically lacks the full three-dimensional topology of the tube, being adapted from graphene theory.

A popular choice for this freedom is the minimization of spatial variance, which leads to maximally localized Wannier functions. We minimize a weighted sum of the spatial and energy variances, yielding what we call dually localized Wannier functions. Localization in energy results in Wannier functions that are associated with a particular energy and allows for dually localized Wannier functions to be comprised of occupied and unoccupied spaces simulatneously. This can lead to Wannier functions that are fractionally occupied, which is a key feature that is used in correcting the delocalization error in density functional approximations. We show how this type of localization results in bonding (antibonding) functions for the occupied (unoccupied) spaces around the frontier energy of silicon in the diamond lattice and of molecular ethylene.

Here, we report on a fundamentally new pathway for magnetization reversal that is mediated by an antiferromagnetic state. Consequently, an atomic-scale compensation of the magnetization is realized at the coercive field, instead of the mesoscopic or macroscopic domain cancellation in canonical reversal processes. We demonstrate this unusual magnetization reversal on the Zn-doped polar magnet Fe$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. Hidden behind the conventional ferrimagnetic hysteresis loop, the surprising emergence of the antiferromagnetic phase at the coercive fields is disclosed by a sharp peak in the field-dependence of the electric polarization. In addition, at the magnetization reversal our THz spectroscopy studies reveal the reappearance of the magnon mode that is only present in the pristine antiferromagnetic state. According to our microscopic calculations, this unusual process is governed by the dominant intralayer coupling, strong easy-axis anisotropy and spin fluctuations, which result in a complex interplay between the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Such antiferro-state-mediated reversal processes offer novel concepts for magnetization control, and may also emerge for other ferroic orders.", "output": "The sharp peak in the field-dependence of the electric polarization reveals the surprising emergence of the antiferromagnetic phase at the coercive fields, which is hidden behind the conventional ferrimagnetic hysteresis loop."}, {"instruction": "What is the advantage of using atoms in interferometric applications?", "input": "Interferometry is a prime technique for modern precision measurements.

We predict outstanding thermoelectric performance for GeSe over a broad range of temperatures due to its high Seebeck coefficients, extremely low Lorenz numbers, ultralow total thermal conductivity, and relatively large band gap. In particular, the out-of-plane direction in GeSe presents equivalent or even higher performance than SnSe for temperatures above 500 K.

For two-dimensional Stokes flows, it was recently shown that the non-linear transport problem can be exactly mapped to a complex Burgers equation [Crowdy, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 81, 2526 (2021)]. We first present a very simple derivation of this equation. We then provide fully explicit solutions and find that varying the initial surfactant distribution - pulse, hole, or periodic - results in distinct spreading behaviors. By obtaining the fundamental solution, we also discuss the influence of surface diffusion. We identify situations where spreading can be described as an effective diffusion process but observe that this approximation is not generally valid.

Functional network models often employ rate units that are continuously coupled by analog signals. Is there a qualitative difference implied by these two forms of signaling? We develop a unified mean-field theory for large random networks to show that first- and second-order statistics in rate and binary networks are in fact identical if rate neurons receive the right amount of noise. Their response to presented stimuli, however, can be radically different. We quantify these differences by studying how nearby state trajectories evolve over time, asking to what extent the dynamics is chaotic. Chaos in the two models is found to be qualitatively different. In binary networks we find a network-size-dependent transition to chaos and a chaotic submanifold whose dimensionality expands stereotypically with time, while rate networks with matched statistics are nonchaotic. Dimensionality expansion in chaotic binary networks aids classification in reservoir computing and optimal performance is reached within about a single activation per neuron; a fast mechanism for computation that we demonstrate also in spiking networks.

Using novel analysis methods on glasses generated by molecular dynamics simulations, this paper provides a microscopic understanding of topological anisotropy in silica (SiO$_2$) glass under mechanical loads. The anisotropy observed in silica glass originates from a preferred orientation of SiO$_4$ tetrahedra at both short- and medium-range levels that can be controlled via the mode of mechanical loading.

The classical theory of rubber elasticity is built upon the assumption of entropic elasticity of networks whose constitutive strands are of uniform length. The kinetic theories for vulcanization, computer simulations, and indirect experimental measurements all indicate that the microstructure of vulcanizates is made of polymer strands with a random distribution of length. The polydispersity in strand length is expected to control the mechanical strength of rubber as the overloaded short strands break at small deformations and transfer the load to the longer strands. The purpose of the contributions presented in this thesis is to present simple theories of rubber mechanics that take into account the length distribution of strands and its effect on elasticity and the onset of bulk failure in unfilled and filled elastomers. In unfilled system, the population of short chains is identified as the culprits for damage initiation. Upon deformation of a polydisperse network, shorter strands break at considerably smaller stretches compared to the longer ones. The network alteration continues concurrent with increasing deformation and controls the onset of mechanical failure. In the filled networks, the degradation in network mechanical behavior is assumed to be controlled by the adhesive failure of the short strands adsorbed onto the filler surface.

In light of these studies, this paper investigates wetting and spreading on reactive substrates when inertial effects are dominant using a thermodynamically derived, diffuse interface model of a binary, three-phase material. The liquid-vapor transition is modeled using a van der Waals diffuse interface approach, while the solid-fluid transition is modeled using a phase field approach. The results from the simulations demonstrate an $O \\left( t^{-\\nicefrac{1}{2}} \\right)$ spreading rate during the inertial regime and oscillations in the triple-line position when the metal droplet transitions from inertial to diffusive spreading.

The results from the model exhibit good qualitative and quantitative agreement with a number of recent experimental studies of high-temperature droplet spreading, particularly experiments of copper droplets spreading on silicon substrates. Analysis of the numerical data from the model suggests that the extent and rate of spreading is regulated by the spreading coefficient calculated from a force balance based on a plausible definition of the instantaneous interface energies. A number of contemporary publications have discussed the likely dissipation mechanism in spreading droplets.

By quantifying particle motion perpendicular to shear, we show that particles become more tightly confined to their layers with no concomitant increase in density upon increasing shear rate.

Excluding features with a weak statistical connection to the target variable in training not only drops the dimension of the data, which decreases the time complexity of the algorithm, it also decreases noise within the data which assists in avoiding overfitting. In all, feature selection assists in training a robust statistical model that performs well and is stable. Given the lack of scalability in classical computation, current techniques only consider the predictive power of the feature and not redundancy between the features themselves. Recent advancements in feature selection that leverages quantum annealing (QA) gives a scalable technique that aims to maximize the predictive power of the features while minimizing redundancy. As a consequence, it is expected that this algorithm would assist in the bias/variance trade-off yielding better features for training a statistical model.

However, there are relatively few studies on the hole spin qubits in a single acceptor, which requires only low density of the metallic gates. In particular, the investigation of flexible tunability using controllable strain for fault-tolerant quantum gates of acceptor-based qubits is still lacking.

However, recent experiments reveal that the nonlinear Hall effect can be observed in non-magnetic systems without applying an external magnetic field. The emergence of nonlinear Hall effect under time-reversal symmetric conditions can be explained in terms of non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole arising from inversion symmetry breaking. In this work, we availed realistic tight-binding models, first-principles calculations, and symmetry analyses to explore the combined effect of transverse electric field and strain, which leads to a giant Berry curvature dipole in the elemental buckled honeycomb lattices -- silicene, germanene, and stanene. The external electric field breaks the inversion symmetry of these systems, while strain helps to attain an asymmetrical distribution of Berry curvature of a single valley. Furthermore, the topology of the electronic wavefunction switches from the band inverted quantum spin Hall state to normal insulating one at the gapless point. This band gap closing at the critical electric field strength is accompanied by an enhanced Berry curvature and concomitantly a giant Berry curvature dipole at the Fermi level.

Here, we investigate the effect of promoting diversity on the evolution of social contracts. We considered group-structured populations where individuals play the Stag-hunt game in all groups. We model the diversity incentive as a Snow-drift game played in a single focus group where the individual is more prone to adopt a deviant norm. We show that moderate diversity incentives can change the system dynamics, leading the whole population to move from the locally optimal social normal to the globally optimal one.

Barring superconducting phase coherence, a Fermi arc structure is naturally present in such a pseudogap state, while a full Fermi surface is recovered only in the overdoping without RVB.

In particular, hot spots appear as the enhanced density of states at the endpoints of the \"Fermi arcs\", which can further give rise to a charge-density-wave-like quasiparticle interference pattern. We also find that small Fermi-pockets violating the Luttinger volume can indeed emerge if the secondary doping-induced RVB order is suppressed alone, say, by strong perpendicular magnetic fields. At the critical doping $\\delta^*$ beyond which the primary RVB order vanishes, the fractionalized spin excitations become incoherent which is signaled by a divergent specific heat.

Therein, the solute concentration inside the membrane depends on the bulk concentration, $c_0$, the driving force, $f$, and the polymer volume fraction, $\\phi$. In our model, solute accumulation in the membrane causes a sigmoidal volume phase transition of the polymer, changing its permeability, which, in return, affects the membrane's solute uptake.

Deep learning methods have the potential to invert these complex signals, but previous implementations are often trained only on specific crystal systems or a small subset of the crystal structure and microscope parameter phase space. In this study, we implement a Fourier space, complex-valued deep neural network called FCU-Net, to invert highly nonlinear electron diffraction patterns into the corresponding quantitative structure factor images. We trained the FCU-Net using over 200,000 unique simulated dynamical diffraction patterns which include many different combinations of crystal structures, orientations, thicknesses, microscope parameters, and common experimental artifacts.

First, we show that for processes with finite Markov order, the Fisher information is always asymptotically linear in the number of outcomes, and determined by the conditional distribution of the process' Markov order. Second, we prove with suitable examples that correlations do not necessarily enhance the metrological precision. In fact, we show that unlike for entropic information quantities, in general nothing can be said about the sub- or super-additivity of the joint Fisher information, in the presence of correlations.

However, the existence of external field during the switching limits its practical application, and therefore field-free switching of the L10-FePt is in highly demand. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the field-free switching of the L10-FePt by growing it on vicinal MgO (001) substrates. This method is different from previously established strategies, as it does not need to add other functional layers or create asymmetry in the film structure. We demonstrate the field-free switching is robust and can withstand strong field disturbance up to ~1 kOe. The dependence on vicinal angle, film thickness, and growth temperature demonstrated a wide operation window for the field-free switching of the L10-FePt. We confirmed that the physical origin of the field-free switching is the vicinal surface-induced the tilted anisotropy of L10-FePt. We quantitatively characterize the spin-orbit torques in the L10-FePt films, and found the spin-orbit torques are not significantly influenced by the lattice strain from vicinal substrates.

The quantum environment can have arbitrary (e.g. structured) spectral density. The entanglement can be seen constructively as a Lego: its bricks are the modes of the environment. These bricks are connected to each other via operator transforms. The central result is that each infinitesimal time interval one new (incoming) mode of the environment gets coupled (entangled) to the open system, and one new (outgoing) mode gets irreversibly decoupled (disentangled from future). Moreover, each moment of time, only a few relevant modes (3 - 4 in the considered cases) are non-negligibly coupled to the future quantum motion. These relevant mode change (flow, or renormalize) with time. As a result, the temporal entanglement has the structure of a matrix-product operator. This allows us to pose a number of questions and to answer them in this work: what is the intrinsic quantum complexity of a real time motion; does this complexity saturate with time, or grows without bounds; how to do the real-time renormalization group in a justified way; how the classical Brownian stochastic trajectories emerge from the quantum evolution; how to construct the few-mode representations of non-Markovian environments.

To include the interplay one could calculate the local yield strain for a given particulate system and follow its evolution, but this is expensive and requires knowledge of particle interactions, which is often hard to extract from experiments. Instead, we introduce a structural quantity, \"softness,\" obtained using machine learning to correlate with imminent plastic rearrangements.

We provide a rigorous derivation of the DTWA by embedding it in a continuous phase space, thereby introducing a hybrid discrete-continuous truncated Wigner approximation (DCTWA).

We examine here this apparent contradiction by probing the spatial organization of the damage activity and its evolution until localization during compression experiments of 2D cellular solids. The intermittent damage evolution measured in our experiments is adequately described by a non-stationary depinning equation derived from damage mechanics and reminiscent of critical phenomena. In this description, precursors are damage cascades emerging from the interplay between the material's disorder and the long-range stress redistributions following individual damage events. Yet, the divergence of their characteristic size close to failure, which we observe in our experiments, is not the signature of a transition towards criticality. Instead, the system remains at a fixed distance to the critical point at all stages of the damage evolution. The divergence results from the progressive loss of stability of the material as it is driven towards localization.

Close to the transition, the relevant degrees of freedom (Polyakov loop) transform under these centre symmetries, and the effective theory only depends on the Polyakov loop and its fluctuations. As shown first by Svetitsky and Yaffe, and subsequently verified numerically, for the $U(1)$ LGT in $(2+1)$-d the transition is in the 2-d XY universality class, while for the $Z_2$ LGT, it is in the 2-d Ising universality class. We extend this classic scenario by adding higher charged matter fields, and show that the notion of universality is generalized such that the critical exponents $\\gamma, \\nu$ can change continuously as a coupling is varied, while their ratio is fixed to the 2-d Ising value. While such weak universality is well-known for spin models, we demonstrate this for LGTs for the first time.

In particular, we show that the presence of $m_{zfs}$ has a noticeable impact on the gap opening in Andreev bound state, which occurs in finite angle of incidence. This directly results in zero-energy Andreev state being dominant.

Initially, a ring is considered to be in an eigenstate, i.e. in a commensurate configuration with equal site fillings and equal phase differences between neighboring sites. Such a ring should exhibit a circulating current whose value will depend on the initial, non-zero phase difference. The appearance of such currents is a signature of an established coherence along the ring. If phase difference falls between $\\pi/2$ and $3\\pi/2$ and interparticle interaction in condensates exceeds a critical interaction value $u_c$, the coherence is supposed to be quickly destroyed because the system enters a chaotic regime due to inherent instabilities. This is, however, only a part of the story.

A pump pulse excites in-plane optical phonon modes in monolayer graphene and a circularly polarised pulse is employed to probe the excited phonon dynamics that generates higher-order harmonics. We show that the coherent phonon dynamics alters the dynamical symmetry of graphene with the probe pulse and leads the generations of the symmetry-forbidden harmonics. Moreover, sidebands associated with the prominent harmonic peaks are generated as a result of the coherent dynamics.

A particularly promising approach to overcome those difficulties is reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT): It abandons the complexity of the $N$-particle wave function and at the same time explicitly allows for fractional occupation numbers. It is the goal of this thesis to initiate and establish a bosonic RDMFT for both ground state and excited state energy calculations. Motivated by the Onsager and Penrose criterion which identifies RDMFT as a particularly suitable approach to describe Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), we derive the universal functional for a homogeneous BEC in the Bogoliubov regime. Remarkably, the gradient of the universal functional is found to diverge repulsively in the regime of complete condensation. This introduces the new concept of a BEC force, which provides a universal explanation for quantum depletion since it is merely based on the geometry of quantum states. In the second part of the thesis, we propose and work out an ensemble RDMFT targeting excitations in bosonic quantum systems. This endeavour further highlights the potential of convex analysis for the development of functional theories in the future. Indeed by resorting to several concepts from convex analysis, we succeeded to provide a comprehensive foundation of $\\boldsymbol{w}$-ensemble RDMFT for bosons which is further based on a generalization of the Ritz variational principle and a constrained search formalism.

For larger bulk band gaps and hard domain walls backscattering is expected to become significant. Here, we show that in this experimentally relevant regime, the reflection of a wave at a sharp corner becomes highly sensitive on the orientation of the outgoing waveguide relative to the underlying lattice.

Specifically, we examine the stability of supercurrents in the polar phase in the vicinity of the Mott insulating phase with even filling factors. Solving the linearized TDGL equation, we obtain gapless spin-nematic modes and gapful spin-wave modes in the polar phase that arise due to the breaking of $S^2$ symmetry in spin space. Supercurrents exhibit dynamical instabilities induced by growing collective modes. In contrast to the second-order phase transition, the critical momentum of mass currents is finite at the phase boundary of the first-order superfluid-Mott insulator (SF-MI) phase transition. Furthermore, the critical momentum remains finite throughout the metastable SF phase and approaches zero towards the phase boundary, at which the metastable SF state disappears. We also study the stability of spin currents motivated by recent experiments for spinor gases. The critical momentum of spin currents is found to be zero, where a spin-nematic mode causes the dynamical instability.

As a consequence, peculiar features in the persistent current arise. The elementary flux quantum, which fixes the persistent current periodicity, is observed to evolve from a single particle one to an extreme case of fractional flux quantum, in which one quantum is shared by all the particles. We show that the persistent current depends on the number of spin components $N$, number of particles and interaction in a specific way that in certain physical regimes has universality traits.

Recently, a generic early-time deviation from the RMT behavior, which we call the 'bump', has been shown to exist in random quantum circuits and spin chains as toy models for many-body quantum chaotic systems. Here we demonstrate the existence of the 'bump-ramp-plateau' behavior in the SFF for a number of paradigmatic, stroboscopically-driven cold atom models of interacting bosons in optical lattices and spinor condensates. We find that the scaling of the many-body Thouless time $t_{\\text{Th}}$ -- the time of the onset of the (RMT) ramp behavior -- and the increase of the bump amplitude in atom number are significantly slower in (effectively 0D) chaotic spinor gases than in 1D optical lattices, demonstrating the role of locality in many-body quantum chaos. Moreover, $t_{\\text{Th}}$ scaling and the bump amplitude are more sensitive to variations in atom number than the system size regardless of the hyperfine structure, the symmetry classes, or the choice of the driving protocol.

From our analytic results we find that the optimal geometry for this diodic behavior strongly depends on the flow rate, the ideal ratio of tip-to-base-radii being equal to 0.22 at zero flow. With increased flow this optimal ratio becomes smaller and simultaneously the diodic performance becomes weaker. Consequently an optimal diode is obtained at zero-flow, which is realized by applying a pressure drop that is proportional to the applied potential and to the inverse square of the tip radius thereby countering electro-osmotic flow.

By employing renormalization group techniques, we study the fate of density wave phases (spin-density and charge-density waves) formed by the nesting of parts of the Fermi surface when a higher order van Hove singularity (HOVHS) appears in parallel. We find that the phase formation can be boosted by the presence of the singularity depending on the strength of certain interactions, with the critical temperature increasing by orders of magnitude.

Here we contend that the necessary conditions for the CISS effect to appear can be generally and fully understood on the basis of a complete symmetry analysis of the molecular junction, and not only of the molecule. Our approach, which draws on the use of point-group symmetries within the scattering formalism for transport, shows that electrode symmetries are as important as those of the molecule when it comes to the emergence of a spin-polarization and, therefore, a possible appearance of CISS. It turns out that standalone metallic nanocontacts can exhibit spin-polarization when relative rotations are introduced which reduce the symmetry. As a corollary, molecular junctions with $\\textbf{achiral}$ molecules can also exhibit spin polarization along the direction of transport, provided that the whole junction is chiral.

A non-resonant pumping signal has the advantage of being separated in frequency from the single photons, but it typically triggers -- or makes active use of -- incoherent phonon-assisted scattering events, which preclude near unity fidelity in the population inversion and deteriorate the quality of the emitted photons. Here, we theoretically show that a coherent di-chromatic pumping scheme using short laser pulses and moderately large detuning effectively decouples the emitter from its phonon bath, allowing for population inversion arbitrarily close to unity. When considering a micropillar single-photon source driven with this scheme, we calculate very high photon emission into the cavity mode (0.953 photons per pulse), together with excellent indistinguishability (0.975). Such values are uniquely bounded by decoherence in the emission dynamics or practical considerations, and not by the excitation scheme.", "output": "A non-resonant pumping signal has the advantage of being separated in frequency from the single photons."}, {"instruction": "What is the proposed method to calculate the carrier mobility of Janus TMDs?", "input": "Two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a new class of materials with unique physical properties.

The central result is that each infinitesimal time interval one new (incoming) mode of the environment gets coupled (entangled) to the open system, and one new (outgoing) mode gets irreversibly decoupled (disentangled from future). Moreover, each moment of time, only a few relevant modes (3 - 4 in the considered cases) are non-negligibly coupled to the future quantum motion. These relevant mode change (flow, or renormalize) with time. As a result, the temporal entanglement has the structure of a matrix-product operator.

Topological stability of knots is one of the many examples of their important properties that can be used in information storage and transfer. Knot dynamics is important for understanding general principles of entanglement as knots provide an isolated system where tangles are highly controlled and easily manipulated. To unravel the dynamics of these entangled topological objects, the first step is to identify the dominant motions that are uniquely guided by knot structure and its complexity. We identify and classify motions into three main groups -- orthogonal, aligned, and mixed motions, which often act in unison, orchestrating the complex dynamics of knots. The balance between these motions is what creates an identifiable signature for every knot. As knot complexity increases, the carefully orchestrated dynamics is gradually silenced, eventually reaching a state of topologically driven dynamical arrest. Depending on their complexity, knots undergo a transition from nearly stochastic motions to either non-random or even quasiperiodic dynamics before culminating in dynamical arrest. Here, we show for the first time that connectivity alone can lead to a topology-driven dynamical arrest in knots of high complexity.

Particularly, this restriction applies to SAW-driven quantum experiments with single flying electrons, where extra modulation renders the exact position of the transported electron ambiguous and leads to undesired spin mixing. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating single-shot chirp synthesis of a strongly compressed acoustic pulse. Employing this solitary SAW pulse to transport a single electron between distant quantum dots with an efficiency exceeding 99%, we show that chirp synthesis is competitive with regular transduction approaches. Performing a time-resolved investigation of the SAW-driven sending process, we outline the potential of the chirped SAW pulse to synchronize single-electron transport from many quantum-dot sources.

In this work, we demonstrate a scalable classical shadow tomography approach for generic randomized measurements implemented with finite-depth local Clifford random unitary circuits, which interpolates between the limits of Pauli and Clifford measurements. The method combines the recently proposed locally-scrambled classical shadow tomography framework with tensor network techniques to achieve scalability for computing the classical shadow reconstruction map and evaluating various physical properties. The method enables classical shadow tomography to be performed on shallow quantum circuits with superior sample efficiency and minimal gate overhead and is friendly to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

This study aims to extend the range of such a statistical mechanics theory by introducing a perhaps novel conceptual model. We consider an inviscid two-dimensional flow contained in a bounded domain, the shape of which is distorted by an externally imposed force. Unlike the usual fixed boundary cases, the flow energy within the domain is exchanged with the external system via pressure work through the moving lateral boundary. Concurrently, the flow field remains constrained by vorticity conservation. The vorticity equation expanded onto time-dependent Laplacian eigenfunctions and subsequently truncated at a finite number satisfies Liouville's theorem. Consequently, based on energy and enstrophy constraints, a grand-canonical ensemble (GCE) is defined with a negative or positive temperature. Beginning from the GCE, when the domain shape is distorted from one shape to another in a finite time, the Jarzynski equality is established. The pressure work performed on the system is thus related to the difference in the Helmholtz free energy. The direction of the inequality between the mean work and the free energy difference derived from the Jarzynski equality depends on the sign of the initial temperature. If the temperature is negative, the pressure work irreversibly extracts flow energy from the system.

Disorders enhance the low-energy density of states but meanwhile shorten the lifetime of fermions, which tend to promote and suppress superconductivity, respectively. To determine which of the two competing effects wins, we study the interplay of Cooper pairing interaction and disorder scattering by means of renormalization group method. We consider three types of disorders, including random mass, random gauge potential, and random chemical potential, and show that the first two suppress superconductivity. In particular, the critical BCS coupling $|u_{c}|$ is increased to certain larger value if the system contains only random mass or random gauge potential, which makes the onset of superconductivity more difficult. In the case of random chemical potential, the effective disorder parameter flows to the strong coupling regime, where the perturbation expansion breaks down and cannot provide a clear answer concerning the fate of superconductivity. When different types of disorder coexist in one system, their strength parameters all flow to strong couplings. In the strong coupling regime, the perturbative renormalization group method becomes invalid, and one needs to employ other methods to treat the disorder effects.

One-dimensional quantum point contacts are a powerful tool to probe both energy and directional dependence of spin-orbit interaction through the effect on the hole $g$-factor. In this work we investigate the role of cubic crystal asymmetry in driving an oscillation in the in-plane hole $g$-factor anisotropy when the quantum point contact is rotated with respect to the crystal axes, and we are able to separate contributions to the Zeeman Hamiltonian arising from Rashba and cubic crystal asymmetry spin-orbit interactions. The in-plane $g$-factor is found to be extremely sensitive to the orientation of the quantum point contact, changing by a factor of $5$ when rotated by $45^{\\circ}$. This exceptionally strong crystal lattice anisotropy of the in-plane Zeeman splitting cannot be explained within axially symmetric theoretical models.

Comparison with a coupled mode theory model explains the data and permits to infer the relevant system parameters.

For the same porosity, the effects of mean-void-size are checked. It is found that, local turbulence mixing and volume dissipation are two important mechanisms for transformation of kinetic energy to heat. When the porosity is very small, the shocked portion may arrive at a dynamical steady state; the voids in the downstream portion reflect back rarefactive waves and result in slight oscillations of mean density and pressure; for the same value of porosity, a larger mean-void-size makes a higher mean temperature. When the porosity becomes large, hydrodynamic quantities vary with time during the whole shock-loading procedure: after the initial stage, the mean density and pressure decrease, but the temperature increases with a higher rate. The distributions of local density, pressure, temperature and particle-velocity are generally non-Gaussian and vary with time.

Monolayer graphene does not display dehydration-induced selectivity until the pore radius is small enough to exclude the first hydration layer from inside the pore.

Measurement of selectivity and activation barriers from both first and second hydration layer barriers will help elucidate the behavior of biological ion channels. Moreover, the energy barriers responsible for selectivity -- while small on the scale of hydration energies -- are already relatively large, i.e., many $k_B$.

Recently, various Lindbladian QMEs were derived without resorting to the secular approximation from the Redfield equation which does not guarantee the complete positivity. Here we explicitly calculate, in a perturbative manner, the equilibrium steady states of these Lindbladian QMEs. We compare the results with the steady state of the Redfield equation obtained from an analytic continuation method, which coincides with the so-called mean force Gibbs (MFG) state. The MFG state is obtained by integrating out the bath degrees of freedom for the Gibbs state of the total Hamiltonian. We explicitly show that the steady states of the Lindbladian QMEs are different from the MFG state. Our results indicate that manipulations of the Redfield equation needed to enforce complete positivity of a QME drives its steady state away from the MFG state.

Nonlinear responses are often closely related to the multiband nature of the system which can be taken into account by the geometric quantities such as the Berry curvature as shown in the nonlinear Hall effect. Theoretically, the semi-classical Boltzmann treatment or the reduced density matrix method have been often employed, in which the effect of dissipation is included through the relaxation time approximation. In the diagrammatic method, the relaxation is treated through the imaginary part of the self-energy of the Green function and the consequent broadening of the spectral function for the integration over the real frequency. Therefore, the poles of the Green function do not play explicit pole when there is finite dissipation. In this paper, in stark contrast to this conventional picture, we show that the poles of the Green function determine mostly the nonlinear response functions with dissipation, which leads to the terms with the Fermi distribution function of complex argument and results in the dissipation-induced geometric term. We elucidate the geometric origin of the nonreciprocal conductivity, which is related to the Berry curvature generalized to the higher derivative.

Remarkably, this steering can be chosen so gently that the basic properties of the underlying measurement-induced transition, such as entanglement structure and critical exponents, are not modified. Pre-selection introduces a unique dark or absorbing state with macroscopic order, replacing the maximally mixed stationary state of the unconditioned measurement trajectory ensemble.

The master curve only depends on the liquid properties and on the thermal gradient, and allows a measurement of the latter. As the films further thin down to thicknesses within the range of molecular interactions, a deviation from the master curve appears.

Estimation of the change in magnetic entropy as a function of temperature from T = 0 K to T = 195 K, dS_mag = 14.86 J/mol_Fe^3+ K, is also in good agreement with the dS_mag = Rln(2S+1) = 14.9 J/mol K expected for a S = 5/2 system. In comparison to the pure jarosites, where both structure and magnetism remain largely invariant upon a variety of chemical substitutions, the replacement of one sulfate group per formula unit with a higher-valent phosphate group applies additional steric and electronic pressure on the kagom\\'e lattice in corkite, further frustrating the magnetic ground state of the material.

These two regimes are separated by an upper critical dimension, which is determined here explicitly and which depends on the range of the intermolecular forces. In the fluctuation-dominated regime, representing the universality class of systems with short-ranged forces, the exponent is related to the value of the interfacial wandering exponent $\\zeta$ by $\\beta_{\\rm osc}=3\\zeta/(4-\\zeta)$.

We start by constructing an exact large-deformation solution to the equations of elasticity for such fibre subject to imposed twist and stretch, which reveals spontaneous warping and twisting of the fibre cross-section absent in passive rubbers. We then compute the corresponding non-linear elastic energy, which encompasses the Poynting effect, but is minimized by a finite spontaneous twist and stretch. In the second half of the paper, we apply these results to understand the twist-contraction actuation of nematic elastomer fibres fabricated with director-fields that encode helical patterns of contraction on heating. We first consider patterns making a constant angle with respect to the local cylindrical coordinate system (conical spiral director curves) and verify the predicted spontaneous twist, contraction and cross-section deformation via finite elements. Secondly, we consider realistic director distributions for the experimentally reported fibres fabricated by cross-linking while simultaneously applying stretch and twist. Counter-intuitively, we find that maximum actuation twist is produced by applying a finite optimal twist during fabrication. Finally, we illustrate that spontaneously twisting fibres will coil into spring-like shapes on actuation if the ends are prevented from twisting relative to each other. Such twist-torsion coupling would allow to make a tendril-like \"soft-spring\" actuator with low force and high linear stroke compared to the intrinsic contraction of the elastomer itself.", "output": "The Poynting effect is a manifestation of large strain elasticity where a cylindrical rubber fibre subject to twist will also elongate."}, {"instruction": "What is the granular capillary length?", "input": "When sand flows out of a funnel onto a surface, a three dimensional pile that is stabilized by friction grows taller as it spreads.

The resulting interaction attempts to convert a single photon excitation into a shower of low-energy photons, but fails due to the MBL mechanism, which manifests as a striking spectral fine structure of multi-particle resonances at the cavity's standing wave mode frequencies.

In contrast to the planar situation, the flows generate additional defects of positive index. For the simpler situation of two vortices, we analytically predict the location of these stagnation points. At the low curvature limit, the dynamics resemble that of vortices in an ideal fluid, but considerable deviations occur at high curvatures. The geometric formulation allows us to construct the spatio-temporal evolution of streamline topology of the flows resulting from hydrodynamic interactions between the vortices.

The AFM-A structure is a metal, while AFM-CE is an insulator and the transition to the insulating state is accompanied by the charge Mn$^{3+}$/Mn$^{4+}$, and orbital $3x^2-r^2$/$3y^2-r^2$ orderings. This orbital ordering results in strong cooperative Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions, which lower the crystal symmetry.

The agent interactions, generally, can depend on the distance between the agents, varying from short-range to long-range interactions. The emphasis in the paper is on long-range interactions. In a mixed society consisting of agents with both long-term and short-term memory, there appears the effect of spontaneous excitation of preference waves, when the fractions of agents preferring this or that alternative suddenly start strongly oscillating, either periodically or chaotically.

The approach and separation were simulated by moving one slab in discrete steps normal to the surfaces allowing for electronic and atomic relaxations after each step. Various configurations were analyzed by considering (001), (011), and (111) surfaces as well as several lateral arrangements of these surfaces at the interface. Several tests were conducted on the computational setup, for example, by changing the system size or using different approximations for the exchange correlation functional. The performed simulations revealed the influences of these aspects on adhesion, equilibrium distance, and material transfer. These interfacial properties depend sensitively on the chosen configuration due to distinct bond situations. Material transfer, in particular, was observed if the absolute value of the adhesion energy for a given configuration is larger than the energy cost to remove surface layers. This result was found to be independent of the employed exchange correlation functional.

The theorem has been a milestone in magnetism and has been driving the research of recently discovered 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials from fundamentals up to potential applications.

We demonstrate that magnetic ordering can be created in flakes of 2D materials independent of the lattice symmetry due to the intrinsic nature of the spin exchange interactions and finite-size effects in two-dimensions. Surprisingly we find that the crossover temperature, where the intrinsic magnetisation changes from superparamagnetic to a completely disordered paramagnetic regime, is weakly dependent on the system length, requiring giant sizes (e.g., of the order of the observable universe ~10$^{26}$ m) in order to observe the vanishing of the magnetic order at cryogenic temperatures as expected from the Mermin-Wagner theorem.

In the low-temperature limit and for a constant compressive force, Euler buckling theory predicts a sudden transition from a compressed to a bent state in these slender rods. In this paper, we use a mean-field theory to show that if a semiflexible chain is compressed at a finite temperature with a fixed end-to-end distance (permitting fluctuations in the compressive forces), it exhibits a continuous phase transition to a buckled state at a critical level of compression, and we determine a quantitatively accurate prediction of the transverse position distribution function of the midpoint of the chain that indicates the transition. We find the mean compressive forces are non-monotonic as the extension of the filament varies, consistent with the observation that strongly buckled filaments are less able to bear an external load. We also find that for the fixed extension (isometric) ensemble that the buckling transition does not coincide with the local minimum of the mean force (in contrast to Euler buckling).
